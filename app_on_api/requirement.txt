**App Development Prompt:**

**Objective:**

Develop a web application with the following features:

1. **Login Page:**
   - Users will start at a login page.
   - Implement authentication based on a username and password.
   - Upon successful login, users will be redirected to the dashboard.

2. **Dashboard:**
   - The dashboard will have four buttons: "Users," "Transactions," "Logs," and "Logout."
   - Each button will lead to a respective section of the application.

3. **Users Section:**
   - **CRUD Operations:** Users will be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete user accounts.
   - To create a new user:
     - Collect the username and password.
     - Convert these credentials into an authentication token.
     - Save the userâ€™s full name along with the token.
   - Display a list of users with options to update or delete each user.

4. **Transactions Section:**
   - **CRUD Operations:** Users will be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete transactions.
   - Each transaction will be linked to a user.
   - Provide a form to input transaction details and options to view, update, or delete transactions.

5. **Logs Section:**
   - **Read-Only Access:** Display a list of logs.
   - Each log entry will record actions performed by users (e.g., creation, updates, deletions).
   - The logs should be sorted and viewable in a user-friendly format.

6. **Logging Actions:**
   - Every user action (e.g., creating a new user, updating a transaction) will be recorded in the logs.
   - Ensure that log entries are automatically updated with relevant details when actions are performed.

**Additional Requirements:**

- Ensure secure handling of authentication and user data.
- Implement responsive design for usability on various devices.
- Provide clear error messages and validation feedback.
